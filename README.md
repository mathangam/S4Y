This project is a zoo of mathematical creatures that roam in different mathematical ecosystem. Each creature lives in its own surrounding theories and it is for the mathematical student to do, play and see experientially.   

With the existential nature of the results in mathematics and the limits of geometric imagination, let this list of mathematical objects be used when doing one's studies in areas like real analysis, functional analysis, fixed point theory etc to actually see a mathematical phenomenon.
